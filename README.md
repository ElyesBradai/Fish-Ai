# Magnet AI

Magnet AI is a project designed to simulate the interaction between magnetic fields and charges. The user can create custom maps, place magnetic fields within them, and observe how charges interact with these fields. The AI component of the project determines the strength and direction of the magnetic fields and calculates the starting angle of the charge based on the user-defined parameters.

## Features

- **Customizable Maps**: Users have complete freedom to design maps of any size (X-Y dimensions) and layout.
- **Magnetic Field Placement**: Users can place magnetic fields anywhere within the map.
- **AI Calculations**: The AI component calculates the strength and direction of magnetic fields and determines the starting angle of charges.
- **Parallel Simulations**: Multiple simulations can run concurrently, allowing for efficient testing and analysis.
- **Flexible Architecture**: Users can design the architecture of the tree to suit their specific needs.

## Getting Started

To get started with Magnet AI, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the necessary dependencies.
3. Run the application and start designing your custom maps.
4. Place magnetic fields and observe their effects on charges.
5. Experiment with different configurations and analyze the results.
   
## Setup instructions
1. IDE: intelliJ
2. java version: 21, graalvm-jdk-21
3. Build System: Maven
